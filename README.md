## ðŸ›  Problem Statement

Businesses today generate massive volumes of data across various regions and markets.  
Analyzing this data efficiently through cloud-based systems like **AWS Athena** and visualizing it using **Power BI** enables companies to make better strategic decisions.

This project focuses on analyzing **Video Game Sales** data across multiple regions using data sourced from **Amazon Athena** (via ODBC connection) and building actionable insights with Power BI dashboards.

---

## ðŸ›¤ Steps Followed

- Data was ingested into Power BI via **ODBC connection** to **Amazon Athena**.
- Data cleansing and transformation were performed using **Power Query Editor**:
  - Unpivoting operations for better regional comparison.
  - Handling missing values and data type corrections.
- Key DAX measures and aggregations were created for:
  - Global Sales
  - Regional Sales by Genre
  - Sales Trends over Time
- Dashboard pages were designed using:
  - Radar Charts
  - Matrix Visuals
  - Line Charts
  - Slicers and Bookmarks for enhanced interactivity
- A professional dashboard theme and navigation bookmarks were applied.
- The report was published to **Power BI Service** for easy access and collaboration.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights Derived

- **Regional Focus:**
  - North America consistently shows the highest sales volume compared to Europe, Japan, and Other regions.
- **Genre Performance:**
  - Action, Sports, Shooter, and Role-Playing games dominate sales figures across regions.
- **Trend Analysis:**
  - Sales peaked around the early 2000s, with gradual declines in later years.
- **Dynamic Filtering:**
  - Unpivoted slicers enable interactive filtering by genre and region for dynamic radar chart updates.

## ðŸ§  Key DAX Measures Used

1. **Total Sales (Global Sales):**
```DAX
Total Global Sales = SUM(SalesData[Global_Sales])

    Regional Sales by Genre:

Total NA Sales = SUM(SalesData[NA_Sales])
Total EU Sales = SUM(SalesData[EU_Sales])
Total JP Sales = SUM(SalesData[JP_Sales])
Total Other Sales = SUM(SalesData[Other_Sales])

    Sales Trend by Year and Genre:

Sales by Year = 
SUMMARIZE(
    SalesData,
    SalesData[Year],
    "Total Sales", SUM(SalesData[Global_Sales])
)
```
